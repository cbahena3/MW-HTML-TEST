        “MissionWired was with the Biden campaign from the very beginning and helped build the fundraising
        infrastructure starting during the primary. They are fast, responsive, and intuitively understand the digital
        fundraising space. I'm glad we called on them when we did,”
      </b>
      says Patrick Bonsignore, Paid Media Director of the Biden-Harris for President team.
